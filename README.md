Welcome to the new Tizeti Frontend Module. 

To ensure you have a smooth running on the project files, kindly follow these steps: 

1. After cloning the project, kindly run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
2. If you want to add a new package to the project, run `yarn add *package name*`.
3. To start the project run `yarn dev`. 

Please note that `vite` is used in the project and the speed might be of a suprise for you especially if you are coming from an *npm* background. # tizeti-new
